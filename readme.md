# Machine Learning Papers Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning papers from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code that helps in understanding the underlying concepts and algorithms presented in these papers.

## Overview

Machine learning papers often present novel algorithms, architectures, or techniques that advance the field. This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation by providing code that closely follows these papers. Each implementation is written in Python mainly(if they use any other language or concepts it will be written explicitly in the directory of the paper), focusing on clarity and educational value.

## Papers Implemented

(This section will be updated as new papers are implemented)

1. [Paper Title 1](link-to-paper) - Brief description
2. [Paper Title 2](link-to-paper) - Brief description
3. ...

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaditya29/Implementing-ML-Papers.git
   cd Implementing-ML-Papers
   ```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
ml-papers-implementation/
│
├── paper1_name/
│   ├── implementation.py
│   ├── utils.py
│   └── README.md
│
├── paper2_name/
│   ├── implementation.py
│   ├── utils.py
│   └── README.md
│
├── tests/
│
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

Each paper implementation has its own directory containing the main implementation file, utility functions, and a README with specific details about the paper and implementation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add an implementation of a paper or improve an existing one, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-paper-implementation`)
3. Implement the paper or make your changes
4. Add tests for your implementation
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add implementation of Paper X'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-paper-implementation`)
7. Create a new Pull Request

Please ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate documentation.
